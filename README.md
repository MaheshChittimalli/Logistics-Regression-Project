## **Project Title**:-
Predict the heart attack disease for organisation WHO(World Health Organization) . using machine learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease in increasing or decreasing manner.

## **_Problem Statement_**
A WHO estimated 12 million death records.One of them half off the death result is found in US.The research intenders the researchers scholar pointout the most relevant risk factor of heartattack As a datascience engineer predict the overall risk using machine learning alogorithm which is called as logistic regression

# Task 1:
Import the libraries
# Task2:
Import the data set to your used workspace
# Task 3:
Use a appropriate argument of sklearn library to train,test and split the dataset
# Task 4: 
Fit your values with the arrange  using feature scaling
# Task 5 : 
Check your model accuracy and precision using confusion matrix
